# Store Rating System — Frontend (React + Vite)

A frontend for the **Store Rating System** built with **React 18** and **Vite**.  
This app is the client for a backend API (Express + Sequelize) and supports three roles:

- **Normal User** — browse stores, give/update ratings, edit profile  
- **Store Owner** — view ratings for their store(s) and see who rated them  
- **Admin** — manage users, stores and view dashboard stats

## 🔌 API Configuration

The api/axiosClient.js file handles base URL configuration and JWT token injection for all requests.

```javascript
const axiosClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL,
  withCredentials: true,
});

axiosClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (token) config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return config;
});
